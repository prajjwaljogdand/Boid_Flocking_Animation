Simulating flock of birds using p5.js 



Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds. \
As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of emergent behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules. The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:

separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates\
alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates\
cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates

The boids framework is often used in computer graphics, providing realistic-looking representations of flocks of birds and other creatures, such as schools of fish or herds of animals. It was for instance used in the 1998 video game Half-Life for the flying bird-like creatures seen at the end of the game on Xen, named "boid" in the game files.

The Boids model can be used for direct control and stabilization of teams of simple Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV)[5] or Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV)[6] in swarm robotics. For stabilization of heterogeneous UAV-UGV teams, the model was adapted for using onboard relative localization by Saska et al.
